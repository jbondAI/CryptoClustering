# CryptoClustering
Applied understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes

## Description

Applies understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price flucuations across various timeframes and specifically, examines price changes over 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

### Skills Demonstrated

The primary skills demonstrated include the ability to:
* Use the standardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize CSV files
* Optimize data using principal component analysis (PCA)
* Find best k-value using scaled data and PCA data 
* Cluster data using K-Means
* Find best k-value using PCA data 
* Determine weighing of principal components

### Dependencies

Python Libraries
* pandas
* datetime
* TBD
